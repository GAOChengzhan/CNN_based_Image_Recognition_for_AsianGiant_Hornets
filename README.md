# CNN-based-Image-Recognition-for-AsianGiant-Hornets
1. Built an Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average model to predict the expansion of hornets 
2. Trained a CNN-based model to distinguish Asian Giant Hornets from other bees 
3. Implemented a multi-parameter optimization technique and finally F1-Score reached 0.992 while accuracy reached 0.987
